\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\popasm\ is the result of many months of work. Despite being the
sole author of this project, I would like to
thank everybody that somehow contributed to this project. Among those
are the hundreds of people who have already
visited \popasm\ home page, talked about it with friends, mailed
me for comments, and so on.

I would also like to thank the ones who use \popasm\ and trust it.
I know I can always count on you for
feedback about this project. \emph{Sourceforge} support was crucial, as
it hosts \popasm\ CVS repository,
home page, and so on. Thank you very much.

Special thanks go to my first university, UFES\cite{UFES}, where
I learned the bulk of my computering skills, and
to those classmates and teachers who believed \popasm\ project,
such as professor and PhD S\'ergio Freitas%
\cite{FREITAS}, who decided to adopt \popasm\ as the assembler for
his graduate classes about assembly language.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my family, friends and God
for what I am now and what I have done so far.
